- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
My initial impression of how Inheritance affects my programming is that it makes it much easier to make new classes that are similar to the parent class. I saved a lot of time not needing to rewrite the information already stored in the building class. Additionally, it made my code a lot nicer to look at as I had less methods for each class.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Something that worked well was getting started early and being very intentional with commenting and documenting exactly what I was doing. All my comments helped me to know exactly what my lines of code did when I came back to it. Also, I did a much better job of keeping my main methods organized so I knew what I was looking at when I ran the code. I think this helped me work through the problems easier than before. Additionally, I looked at the instructions in GitHub rather than in VSCode. I think the format of the instructions in GutHub made them much clearer to follow. I will continue to do this for all my assignments.
